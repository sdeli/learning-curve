1. BEM ======================
	
	Blocks, Elements and Modifiers
	
	Block: Independent, self contained reusable Unit of the design
		- can stand on its own
		- can be reused
		- they are not dependent on any parent element => Single responsibility blocks
	
	Element: A unit dependent on its Block-Unit
	
	Concepts:
	
	- Css Selector should target elements directly with classes / BEM NOTATION
			- no type selectors
			- no descendent selectors
			- eliminate cascade
	
	- CLASS NAMING CONVENTIONS / BEM NOTATION : 
			identify Blocks: class="Blockname"
			identify Elements: class="blockname__elementname"
			identify Modifiers: class="blockname--modifiername"
	
	
	- Without the cascade we can move blocks freely
	
	- Blocks can be nested in other blocks => Single responsibility blocks
	
	- SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY BLOCKS: Blocks are responsible just for themselfs, thatswhy they dont modify other blocks nested in themselfs.

	- DRY / DESIGN PATTERNS
			- Design rules which you follow/apply again and again at blocks and elements
	 		- All Websate parts have features which are the same threwout the webiste likse:

	 						padding/margin bottom
	 						padding/margin top
	 						wrappings
	 						....
	 		- Create css classes for these which are reusable for each design pattern throughout the page

<p> BEM BLOCKS
	
	<ul><strong>Page Section Type Blocks</strong>

		<li> > PAGE SECTIONS / GRID</li>

	</ul>
	
	<ul><strong>Text Type Blocks</strong>

		<li> > PAGE SECTION HEADINGS</li>
		<li> > PARAGRAPH TAGS</li>
		<li> > PARAGRAPH HEADINGS</li>

	</ul>

	<ul> <str>Design Elements</str>

2. CSS - Rules & Conventions
	
	- SIZEs given in REM
			-pl: font-size: 2.9rem;
