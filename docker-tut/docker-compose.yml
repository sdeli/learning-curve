# This docker-compose.yml file tells Docker to do the following:
#     Pull the image we uploaded in step 2 from the registry.
#     Run 5 instances of that image as a service called web, limiting each one to use, at most, 10% of a single core of CPU time (this could also be e.g. “1.5” to mean 1 and half core for each), and 50MB of RAM.
#     Immediately restart containers if one fails.
#     Map port 4000 on the host to web’s port 80.
#     Instruct web’s containers to share port 80 via a load-balanced network called webnet. (Internally, the containers themselves publish to web’s port 80 at an ephemeral port.)
#     Define the webnet network with the default settings (which is a load-balanced overlay network).

#A docker compose file sets up a private network automatically with embedded dns server
