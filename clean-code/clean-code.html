<ol><h1>CLEAN CODE</h1>
    <li>Collective agreements on things, how we do something for code consistency</li>
    
    <group>VARIABLES</group>
    <li>No magic values</li>
    <li>Descriptive variable names - should consist of 2 to 4 words and 8 to 20 characters</li>
    <li>Booleans should be stored in variables, with a descriptive name
        <script>let boolValKeywordsArr = ['should','is','has','can'];</script>
    </li>
    <li>Use Typescript to show that which variable is what</li>
    
    <group>FUNCTIONS</group>
    <li>DOT/Single Responsibility functions
        <span>Easier to give a descriptive name</span>
        <span>Easier to write tests for</span>
    </li>
    <li>Pure functions
        <span>Deterministic</span>
        <span>easier to write test</span>
    </li>
    <li>Few params as possible, maximum 3 | params passed as keys of an object</li>
    <li>More tiny functions are better then few large
        <span>better for nodes performance optimization</span>
    </li>
    <li>No nested functions => makes logic more difficult to understand</li>
    
    <group>CONTROL FLOW</group>
    <li>if conditons should be stored in variable with descriptive name</li>
    <li>if statements should have more lines then 3 | content of stament should be outsources into functions with a descriptive name</li>
    <li>loops should be wrapped into functions with descriptive names</li>
    
    <group>COMMENTS</group>
    <li>Comments are always the sign that you couldn`t express yourself in code</li>
    <li>You shouldnt describe a code in comment which is likely to change</li>
    
    <group>ORGANIZATION OF LOGIC</group>
    <li>1 file 1 set of logic
        <span>if there are more sets of logic (a class called car, which can accelarate, stop, turn on music ....) 
            these should be delegated into separate files and then attached in the main file on the main entity
        </span>
    </li>
    <li>Logic should be readable from top to the bottom => function definitons should be composed in top-down narrative</li>
    <li>No nested logic => No nested functions
         <span>if there is a logic which needs nesting, then that one should be delegated into separate file as a library or submodule</span>
    </li>
    
    <group>ARCHITECTURE</group>
    <li>mvc pattern</li>
    <li>Favor declarative programming over imperative programming => Top Down Analysis</li>
    <li>Modules and Classes should have a clean interface
        <span>interface:Should be documented, what do they need to work properly:
            <li>dependencies, parameters</li>
            <li>how they need to be used in code</li>
            <li>other conditions: they need to have internet connection</li>
        </span>
    </li>
</ol>
